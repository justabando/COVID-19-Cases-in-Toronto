# COVID-19-Cases-in-Toronto

This repo contains all the information necessary to perform statistical analyses of an OpenDataToronto data set concerned with COVID-19 cases in Toronto. 

It is organised as follows:

-The inputs folder contains the raw data used for the project in a .csv format

-The outputs folder contains the Quarto document file with the paper, figures, and references included in a .bib file.

-The scripts folder contains the preliminary set-up for the workspace, including importing the data from OpenDataToronto, the simulation for the data set, and the cleaning processes used to sort and organize the data set to be easier to work with to generate figures.
